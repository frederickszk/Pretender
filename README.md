# Pretender
ðŸŽ‰ Our paper `Pretender: Universal Active Defense against Diffusion Finetuning Attacks` has been accepted by **USENIX Security'25**! [[Paper Link](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~naruan/publications/Pretender_Usenix_ex.pdf)]

Currently, we need additional time to organize the code and prepare instructions and documentation. The related code will be updated in this repository soon. Thank you for your attention to our work!

ðŸ’¦ Note: Since all the code development and organization work is currently being handled by me alone, and I am also in the process of organizing the open-source libraries for two other papers, along with a busy schedule recently, I expect to complete the organization and updates by April 2025. The datasets related to the paper, as well as the core implementation of `Pretender`, can be found at [[Artifacts Link](https://zenodo.org/records/14748741)]. Thank you again for your understanding!
