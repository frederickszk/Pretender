# Pretender
ðŸŽ‰ Our paper `Pretender: Universal Active Defense against Diffusion Finetuning Attacks` has been accepted by **USENIX Security'25**!

Currently, we need additional time to organize the training code and prepare instructions and documentation. The related code will be updated in this repository soon. Thank you for your attention to our work!
